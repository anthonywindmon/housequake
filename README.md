Machine learning classification on a Bank Marketing dataset from UCI Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). Includes implementation of data imbalance techniques (SMOTE, ROS and RUS) and feature selection.

This project includes three different classifiers: Random Forests, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Accuracy is computed for the original dataset (which has imbalance), Random Over & Undersampling and using the top 10 features. Additionally, I calculated the Cohen Kappa Score.
